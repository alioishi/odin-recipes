    <p>Roasted Brussels sprouts taste best when the inside is soft and caramlized while the outside is crispy. The best
        way to
        achieve this is to place Brussels sprouts cut side down when baking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Brussels sprouts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil or fat, such as olive oil (not extra-virgin), avocado oil, or melted ghee</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400°F. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Trim and halve the Brussels sprouts. Trim the bottoms from the sprouts if they appear dry or yellowed, and
            peel away the loose outer leaves. Cut each Brussels sprout in half through the stem.</li>
        <li>Toss with oil and season with salt. Place the Brussels sprouts in a large bowl. Add the oil and toss to coat.
            Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat again.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a baking sheet and roast 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the sprouts to a rimmed baking sheet and
            arrange them cut-side down. Roast until the leaves are dark brown and crisp, and the bottoms of the sprouts
            are browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season as desired. Serve immediately, or toss with additional salt or your favorite sauce or seasonings.</li>
    </ol>
